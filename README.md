Step 1: Import Required Libraries
The code imports necessary libraries:

datasets for loading and processing the dataset.

transformers for working with pretrained language models.

torch for tensor computations.

Other modules: Trainer and TrainingArguments for fine-tuning.


Step 2: Load the Dataset

Dataset: The dataset is loaded from the Hugging Face Hub using the load_dataset function.

Inspection: Prints the dataset's structure (features) and an example (train[0]) for understanding its content.


Step 3: Preprocess the Data

Tokenizer: A tokenizer (e.g., GPT-2 tokenizer) is loaded.

Tokenization Function:

Each example in the dataset is split into input and output fields.

Both fields are tokenized into token IDs with truncation to limit the sequence length to 512 tokens.

labels for the output tokens are added to the tokenized input.


Dataset Mapping:

Applies the tokenize_function to all dataset samples, converting text into tokenized input for model training.

Non-essential columns (input, output) are removed, and the dataset is converted to PyTorch format.



Step 4: Prepare the Model

Model Loading: A pretrained GPT-2 model is loaded for fine-tuning.

GPT-2 is chosen as the base model, but you can replace it with another transformer model if preferred.


Step 5: Configure Training Arguments

TrainingArguments specifies key training parameters:

Output directory for saving results and checkpoints (output_dir).

Evaluation strategy (evaluation_strategy).

Learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

Other configurations like logging and saving model checkpoints.



Step 6: Set Up the Trainer

A Trainer object is created, connecting:

Model, training arguments, and the datasets.

Tokenizer for tokenizing inputs during training and evaluation.



Step 7: Train the Model

trainer.train() initiates the fine-tuning process:

Model learns to map input prompts to responses based on the dataset.

Evaluates performance on the validation set (if specified).



Step 8: Save the Model

Once training is complete:

The fine-tuned model is saved to ./mental_health_chatbot_model.

The tokenizer is also saved for consistent preprocessing during inference.



Step 9: Inference Function

Chatbot Logic:

Prompts are tokenized and fed to the fine-tuned model.

The model generates a response, which is decoded back into text.

The response is returned.



Step 10: Chatbot Interaction

Console-Based Interaction:

The chatbot prompts the user for input.

User input is passed to chatbot_response for a generated response.

This process continues until the user types "exit".



Key Notes

1. Dependencies: Ensure required libraries (datasets, transformers, torch) are installed.


2. Dataset: The heliosbrahma/mental_health_chatbot_dataset should be accessible online.


3. GPU/CPU: For faster training, ensure a GPU is available and properly configured.
